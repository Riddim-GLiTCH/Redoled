# About Virtual Boy by [Riddim GLiTCH](https://github.com/Riddim-GLiTCH/)
Virtual Boy is a Discord theme based on a failed games console by Nintendo of the same name. It sports an amoled background and red accents. <br>
## NOTE: Please check my discord server for issues and notices regarding this theme!
## NOTE 2: Apparently people dont understand this: THE COLORS DO NOT CYCLE. The preview only shows how FLEXIBLE the color configuration is!

## Virtual Boy is customizable. You can easily swap the colors with these modiefiers:
#### Virtual Boy supports [Colorways][colorways] now, Customize your theme with ease!
##### Note: Custom Colorways work best if the values for `Primary`, `Secondary`, and `Tertiary` are put to 0

## Easily tell What messages are yours.
![selfmessage-preview][selfmessage-preview]<br>
With the new SelfMessages addon, Your messages will be shifted to the right side of the screen. Now you wont be confused when someone in the conversation has the same name as you!

Note: This addon requires the use of my [Self-Messages plugin][selfmessages] to function!

## Why did you make this theme?
This is my first ever properly finished Discord theme. I made it cuz I was working on a previous theme with an ex partner of mine, but that project died off due to a breakup. I really wanted to make my own theme though, so I set out to make this.

So far, I've been having a blast working on this. I'm learning a lot of new things, and I feel pretty positive in the Discord Theming community.

## Can I modify this theme for personal use?
Yes, BUT. if you want to publish it, I kindly ask of you to link back to this repository, and make sure people know it's based off this. Also make sure the credits below are clearly shown!

## Contribution?
Yes please! Help is always appreciated! Just make a [pull request][pulls], or let me know what I should add/fix in [issues][issues]!
